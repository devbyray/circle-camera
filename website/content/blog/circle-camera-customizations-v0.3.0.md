I wanted Circle Camera to feel simple but flexible. You install it, turn it on, and it just works. But at the same time, it should adapt to **you**, not the other way around.

That’s why I’m super excited to share what’s new in **v0.3.0**: a bunch of fresh customization options that give you more control over how the camera looks and behaves on your screen.

Let’s take a look 👇

---

## 🎯 Custom shape

Not everyone wants a circle. (I know, ironic for a “Circle Camera” 😅) You can now switch between a **circle** or **square** camera view.  Simple toggle — use whatever fits your content or layout best.


## 🎨 Border customization

Want a bold red border? Or maybe a subtle gray one?  You can now **adjust the border thickness** and **choose your favorite color** with the built-in color picker.  It’s a small detail, but it really makes a difference in how your camera feels on screen.


## 🚀 Easier camera switching

If you have more than one camera connected, you’ll love this. You can now switch between them effortlessly from inside the app. Perfect if you switch setups often or use a different device for meetings vs. recordings.


## ⌨️ Resize how you like

You can now resize your camera window using the **up/down arrow keys** in addition to the on-screen buttons.  
A tiny shortcut, but one that saves you time—especially if you’re tweaking your layout while recording.

## 🔢 See your version

There’s now a small **version indicator** in the UI. This helps you (and me!) know exactly which version you're using, which is handy when sharing feedback or checking for updates.

## Try it out

You can download the latest version of Circle Camera for **macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon)** right now:  
👉 [circlecamera.com/download](https://circlecamera.com/download)

Windows isn’t fully supported yet, but it’s something I’m working on.

If you’re already using the app, you’ll see an automatic update notification—no popup, just a subtle icon. Click "Update Now," and you're all set.
