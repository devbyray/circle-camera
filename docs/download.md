## Installation Instructions

### macOS

1. Download the DMG file.
2. Open the DMG file.
3. Drag the Circle Camera app to your Applications folder.
4. **Important Security Step:** The first time you open Circle Camera, macOS may show a warning saying it cannot verify the developer (see image below). This is expected because the app is not yet notarized by Apple.

5. To allow the app to run:
    * Go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security**.
    * Scroll down to the **Security** section.
    * You should see a message: *"Circle Camera" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.*
    * Click the **"Open Anyway"** button next to the message. You might need to enter your administrator password.
